    <h1> Introduction</h1>
    <p>
        Did you know that depression is one of the most pressing challenges facing teens and young adults aged 19-25 today?
        It doesn't just affect their academic success or social lives—it deeply impacts their happiness and sense of purpose.
        Studies reveal that this age group is particularly vulnerable, as they navigate life-changing transitions such as starting college, pursuing careers, and exploring personal independence.
        The silent weight of depression can cloud their brightest moments, often leaving them feeling isolated and misunderstood.
    </p>
    <p>
        This phase of life is bursting with opportunities: exploring independence, pursuing dreams, building relationships, and shaping the future.
        However, for many, these opportunities come hand-in-hand with overwhelming stress, emotional struggles, and the pressure to succeed.
        The stigma surrounding mental health often prevents young people from seeking help, leaving them to battle their challenges in silence.
        The consequences can be dire, ranging from declining academic performance to strained relationships, and in severe cases, even the tragic loss of life.
    </p>
    <p>
        Here’s the hope: depression is treatable, and no one has to face it alone. By raising awareness, fostering understanding, and taking timely action,
        we can break the stigma and provide young adults with the tools and support they need to overcome these struggles.
        Imagine a world where no young person feels abandoned or powerless—a world where they can confidently pursue their goals and embrace the joy of life.
        Together, we can create such a world. Through compassion, education, and action, we have the power to empower this generation to rise stronger, happier, and more fulfilled than ever before.
