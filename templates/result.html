        <h1> 🔥 High Depression: When It’s Time to Call in Reinforcements </h1>
        <h2> What it feels like? </h2>
        <p> High depression can feel like you’re trapped in a thunderstorm that never ends. It’s an intense, overwhelming state that saps your energy, 
            leaves you feeling hopeless, and may even make you question your purpose. You might feel utterly drained, as if you’re carrying the weight of 
            the world on your shoulders. Concentration becomes nearly impossible, sleep feels elusive, and the simplest tasks can feel like climbing a mountain.
            It’s important to know that even in this darkness, there’s a path toward light—and you don’t have to walk it alone. </p>
        <h2> Your Game Plan: </h2>
        <p> <b> ☞ Reach Out Right Away: </b> Call a therapist, a trusted friend, or a hotline. Help is just a conversation away. <br>
            <b> ☞ Be Gentle with Yourself: </b> Your courage to face this head-on is your superpower. <br>
            <b> ☞ Hold Onto Hope: </b> Every day you take a step toward recovery, you’re rewriting your story. <br>
             </p>
        <p> <b> A Truth to Hold Close: </b> The storm may feel endless, but the skies always clear. You are not alone, and brighter days are ahead. </p>
    {% elif results == "Mild" %}
    <h1> 🌈 Mild Depression: When Your Inner Spark Needs Reigniting </h1>
    <h2> What it feels like? </h2>
    <p> Think of mild depression as walking through life with a foggy lens. You’re going through the motions, 
        checking off your to-do list, but everything feels... dull. Smiles feel forced, and even the things you usually 
        love—like your favorite TV show or a hangout with friends—don’t seem to light you up the way they used to. You may feel a bit stuck, 
        like you’re running on autopilot and can’t quite figure out how to change gears.
    </p>
    <h2> Your Game Plan: </h2>
    <p> <b> ☞ Set Micro-Goals: </b> Tackle one thing at a time. Even checking off “Make coffee” is a win! <br>
        <b> ☞ Explore New Adventures: </b> Always wanted to try pottery, kickboxing, or gardening? Now’s your chance. <br>
        <b> ☞ Talk It Out: </b> Share your feelings with someone who truly listens. Vulnerability builds strength. <br>
         </p>
         <p> <b> Did You Know? </b> Nature is a natural mood booster. Spend time outdoors, soak up some sunlight, and let those feel-good vibes flow! </p>
    {% elif results == "Moderate" %}
    <h1> 🌊 Moderate Depression: Navigating Heavier Waves </h1>
    <h2> What it feels like? </h2>
    <p> Moderate depression can feel like trying to swim in deep water with weights tied to your ankles. Everyday tasks like getting out of bed, 
        focusing at work, or making decisions feel like monumental challenges. It’s more than just a bad day or a passing mood—it’s a persistent heaviness. 
        You might feel like crying for no reason, avoiding social interactions, or struggling to see the purpose in things you once cared about. The good news? 
        You don’t have to face these waves alone.
    </p>
    <h2> Your Game Plan: </h2>
    <p> <b> ☞ Team Up with a Pro: </b> Therapists and counselors are your personal life coaches—don’t hesitate to reach out! <br>
        <b> ☞ Break It Down: </b> Facing a mountain? Conquer it pebble by pebble. Small progress leads to big wins. <br>
        <b> ☞ Find Your Tribe: </b> Connect with others who understand. There’s strength in shared experiences. <br>
    </p>
         <p> <b> You Are Resilient: </b> These moments of struggle are part of your story, but they don’t define you. You’re stronger than you know! </p>

    <h1> 🌟 Low Depression: Your Mind Whispering “I Need a Break” </h1>
    <h2> What it feels like? </h2>
    <p> Ever feel like life’s volume has been turned down just a notch? Low depression is like the quiet hum of exhaustion, a subtle heaviness that 
        makes everything feel just a bit harder. You might find yourself hitting snooze more often, zoning out during conversations, or feeling a slight 
        disconnection from the things that usually bring you joy. It’s as if your inner spark has dulled, but it’s still there, waiting to shine again.
    </p>
    <h2> Your Game Plan: </h2>
    <p> <b> ☞ Move Your Body:</b> A quick dance-off in your living room or a stroll in the park can work wonders. <br>
        <b> ☞ Connect: </b> Call that friend who always makes you laugh. Laughter is medicine! <br>
        <b> ☞ Mini Wins: </b> Try a new recipe, declutter a drawer, or start that book you’ve been eyeing. Small joys add up! <br>
    </p>
         <p> <b> Remember: </b> Sometimes, the smallest steps lead to the biggest changes. You’ve got this! </p>
